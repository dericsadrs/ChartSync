  - `fetch_songs()`: Fetches songs based on user prompt.
  - `generate_response()`: Generates a response using GPT.

## API Keys and Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be set in a `.env` file in the `src` directory:

```
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=your_spotify_redirect_uri
GPT_KEY=your_gpt_api_key
```

## How to Run (Prerequisites and Endpoints)

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.7+
2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install spotipy python-dotenv playwright openai
   ```
3. Install Playwright browsers:
   ```
   playwright install
   ```
4. Set up a Spotify Developer account and create an app to get the required API credentials.
5. Set up an OpenAI account to get the GPT API key.

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Create a `.env` file in the `src` directory with the required environment variables.
3. Run the main script:
   ```
   python src/app.py
   ```

### Endpoints

The application doesn't have explicit endpoints as it's not set up as a web service. However, the main functionality can be accessed through the `PlaylistManager` class:

```python
playlist_manager = PlaylistManager()
result = playlist_manager.create_playlist(chart_type="billboard_hot_100")
print(result)
```
